# Raytracer

This is a self programmed Raytracer to simulate 3D Scenarios.

## How does it work
The Raytracer sends rays and calculate how the visibility of a 3D object is, seen from a specific point in a room.

## Important features
The most important features are:

* Motion Blur-Effect
* Refraction
* Reflection
* Texturierung
* Shadow calculation
* Transformations

## Testing
All tests are defined in the folder "src > testing".

There are the following tests available:

* DOF Camera (TestDOFCamera)
* Motion Blur (TestMotionBlurCamera)
* Reflection (TestReflection)
* Refraction (TestRefraction)
* Sampling (TestSampling)
* Multithreading (TestMultithreading_RayTracer)
* Shadow (TestShadow)
* Transformations (TestTransformation)
* Object Tests for spheres, surfaces, cubes (TestRayTracer)
